# Eight Docs

Welcome to the Eight docs.
This is where you'll be able to find information about Eight, and its development.
At this point in time, this information will be hosted here, however it may move in the future.

The information here is meant to outline the features and goals of Eight.
It should be both high- and low-level detail of the implementation and design of Eight and all of its systems.

The main documents you might be interested in are:
 * [Syntax](syntax.md) - An explanation of the syntax
 * [Semantics](semantics.md) - An overview of the semantics and lower-level implementation
 * [Compatibility](compatibility.md) - A description of how compatibility works with other languages
