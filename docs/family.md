# Eight Language Family

The Eight Language Family is a family of similar languages that all stem from Eight.
The goal of the Eight Language Family is to enable developers to use Eight or an Eight style language in any situation they might want.
This means that dialects are developed with different targets in mind to facilitate these differing targets.

The reason that different targets are developed at all is to avoid confusion when developing.
By using different dialects, it is made a lot more appearant to the developer which dialect they are actually using.

For example, if a project is made to be used in 8d, the project can only use the 8D standard library.
It would be very confusing if the files used the same name.
If a new developer tried to start working on the project without prior information, they might try to use the Eight standard library, which is mostly unavailable in 8D.

By creating a family of languages that target different use cases, we can eliminate this confusion and streamline the development process.
